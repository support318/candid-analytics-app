# Manual Fix Required for Make.com Scenario 3220597

## Issues Found

I analyzed the current scenario configuration and found **two critical issues**:

### Issue 1: OpenAI Module - Literal "1" Instead of Webhook Data
The OpenAI prompt currently contains:
```
Webhook Data:
1
```

It should be:
```
Webhook Data:
{{1}}
```

The `{{1}}` variable isn't being processed - it's literally sending the text "1" to OpenAI.

### Issue 2: HTTP Module - Wrong Field Reference
The HTTP module has:
```
data: {{3.result}}
```

It should be:
```
data: {{3.choices[].message.content}}
```

OpenAI doesn't return a field called "result" - it returns the response in `choices[].message.content`.

## How to Fix

### Step 1: Fix OpenAI Module

1. Open scenario: https://us2.make.com/scenarios/3220597
2. Click on the **OpenAI** module (module 3)
3. Find the line that says "Webhook Data:" followed by just "1"
4. **Delete the "1"**
5. Click in that spot and from the mapping panel on the right, select **module 1 (Custom Webhook)**
6. This should insert `{{1}}` which will pass the entire webhook data
7. Also change **Temperature** from `1` to `0.1` (for more consistent output)
8. Also change **Model** from `gpt-4.1-nano` to `gpt-4o-mini` (more reliable)
9. Save the module

### Step 2: Fix HTTP Module

1. Click on the **HTTP - Make a request** module (module 2)
2. In the **Request content** field, you currently have `{{3.result}}`
3. **Delete** `{{3.result}}`
4. Click in that field, then from the mapping panel:
   - Expand module 3 (OpenAI)
   - Expand "Choices"
   - Expand "Message"
   - Click on "Content"
5. This should insert `{{3.choices[].message.content}}`
6. Save the module

### Step 3: Test

1. Click "Run once" on the scenario
2. Trigger a test webhook from GHL or use the scenario's "Run this module only" option
3. Check the execution history to see if it succeeds

---

## Expected Result

After the fix:
1. **Webhook module** receives GHL data
2. **OpenAI module** receives the full webhook data (not just "1") and parses it into structured JSON
3. **HTTP module** sends the OpenAI's JSON response to your API
4. Your API successfully parses the JSON and creates the inquiry record

---

## Alternative: Simplified Approach

If the above is too complex, you can simplify by **removing the OpenAI module entirely** and going back to the direct approach:

1. Delete the OpenAI module
2. In the HTTP module, change Request content to explicitly map the fields (see the JSON template in MAKE_FIX_REQUIRED.md)

The OpenAI approach is more flexible (handles any webhook structure), but direct mapping is simpler if your webhook structure is consistent.
