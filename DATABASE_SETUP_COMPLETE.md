3. **`reviews`** (64 kB)
   - Client ratings (overall, photographer, videographer, communication, value)
   - NPS scoring (0-10 scale)
   - Automatic sentiment calculation (positive/neutral/negative)
   - Feedback text storage

4. **`lead_sources`** (88 kB)
   - **11 seed records pre-populated:**
     - Google Search, Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Instagram
     - Indeed, LinkedIn, Referral, Direct Website
     - Yelp, Wedding Wire, The Knot
   - Categorized as: organic, paid, referral, direct, social

| `mv_priority_kpis` | ‚úÖ Populated | Dashboard overview metrics |
| `mv_revenue_analytics` | ‚úÖ Populated | Monthly revenue trends |
| `mv_sales_funnel` | ‚úÖ Populated | Inquiry ‚Üí consultation ‚Üí booking conversion |
| `mv_lead_source_performance` | ‚úÖ Populated | Lead source ROI and conversion rates |

**SQL Files:**
- Original: `/database/create_all_materialized_views.sql`
- Fixes: `/database/11-fix-materialized-views.sql`

## Verification Results

### Tables Verified ‚úÖ
```sql
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```
**Result:** All 12 tables exist

### Materialized Views Verified ‚úÖ
```sql
SELECT matviewname, ispopulated FROM pg_matviews WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```
**Result:** All 10 views populated with data

### Sample Data Check ‚úÖ
```sql
-- Priority KPIs
SELECT * FROM mv_priority_kpis;
-- Shows: $1500 month revenue, 96 leads in pipeline, 7 projects in progress

-- Revenue Analytics
SELECT * FROM mv_revenue_analytics LIMIT 5;
-- Shows: October 2025 data with 1 booking

-- Sales Funnel
SELECT * FROM mv_sales_funnel LIMIT 3;
-- Shows: 96 total inquiries in October 2025

-- Lead Sources
SELECT * FROM mv_lead_source_performance;
-- Shows: 96 leads from multiple sources (website, ghl_import, Test)
```

### Seed Data Verified ‚úÖ
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lead_sources;
-- Result: 11 rows (Google Search, Google Ads, Facebook Ads, etc.)
```

## Issues Encountered & Resolved

### 1. ‚ùå Foreign Key Type Mismatch
**Error:** `INTEGER` foreign keys ‚Üí `UUID` primary keys
**Fix:** Changed all `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` and `INTEGER REFERENCES` to `UUID` with `uuid_generate_v4()`

### 2. ‚ùå Consultations Table Join Issue
**Error:** `consultations.inquiry_id` does not exist
**Fix:** Changed join from `i.id = c.inquiry_id` to `i.client_id = c.client_id`

### 3. ‚ùå Date Subtraction EXTRACT Issue
**Error:** `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (date1 - date2))` fails on DATE columns
**Fix:** Used simple date subtraction `(date1 - date2)` which returns INTEGER days

## Current Database State

### ‚úÖ All Tables Created
- All 5 new tables exist with correct UUID schemas
- All foreign keys properly linked
- All indexes created
- All triggers functional

### ‚úÖ All Views Ready
- 10 materialized views created and populated
- Views reference real data from new tables
- Placeholders (zeros) for empty tables (expected until data import)

### üìä Data Status
| Table | Row Count | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `lead_sources` | 11 | ‚úÖ Seeded |
| `staff_assignments` | 0 | ‚è≥ Awaits GHL import |
| `deliverables` | 0 | ‚è≥ Awaits GHL import |
| `reviews` | 0 | ‚è≥ Awaits GHL import |
| `marketing_campaigns` | 0 | ‚è≥ Awaits manual entry |
| `inquiries` | 96 | ‚úÖ Has data |
| `projects` | 7 | ‚úÖ Has data |
| `revenue` | 1 | ‚úÖ Has data |

---

## Next Steps

### 1. ‚è≥ Import Historical Data from GHL
**File to reference:** `import_historical_data.md`

**What needs to be imported:**
- Staff assignments (photographer, videographer, PM assignments)
- Deliverables (photo/video delivery dates from custom fields)
- Reviews (client ratings, NPS scores, feedback)
- Marketing campaign data (if tracked in GHL)

### 2. ‚è≥ Update GHL Webhook Payloads
**Current webhooks need to include:**
- `staff_photographer` ‚Üí `staff_assignments.staff_name` (role: photographer)
- `staff_videographer` ‚Üí `staff_assignments.staff_name` (role: videographer)
- `photo_delivery_date` ‚Üí `deliverables.expected_delivery_date`
- `video_delivery_date` ‚Üí `deliverables.expected_delivery_date`
- `client_rating` ‚Üí `reviews.overall_rating`
- `nps_score` ‚Üí `reviews.nps_score`
- `client_feedback` ‚Üí `reviews.feedback_text`

### 3. ‚è≥ Set Up Automated View Refresh
**Recommendation:** Daily refresh at 2 AM

**Create cron job or Windows Task Scheduler:**
```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_priority_kpis;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_revenue_analytics;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_sales_funnel;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_lead_source_performance;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_revenue_by_location;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_operational_efficiency;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_client_satisfaction;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_client_retention;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_marketing_performance;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_staff_productivity;
```

### 4. ‚è≥ Test Dashboard Tabs
**Once historical data is imported:**
1. Priority KPIs Tab ‚Üí Should show real delivery times and ratings
2. Revenue Analytics Tab ‚Üí Monthly trends by service type
3. Sales Funnel Tab ‚Üí Conversion rates by stage
4. Lead Source Performance ‚Üí ROI by channel
5. Revenue by Location ‚Üí Geographic breakdown
6. Operations Efficiency ‚Üí Delivery metrics by staff member
7. Client Satisfaction ‚Üí NPS and ratings trends
8. Marketing Performance ‚Üí Campaign ROI
9. Staff Productivity ‚Üí Individual performance rankings
10. Client Retention ‚Üí Repeat client percentage
