- Takes requests and brings you the data you need
- Fast and secure
- **This is what we just built!**

**The Frontend (React Dashboard)** = Your dining room/menu
- Beautiful interface where you see your analytics
- Charts, graphs, and KPIs
- **This is now complete!**

**Make.com** = Your automatic delivery service
- Automatically brings new data from Go High Level
- Already configured from previous session
