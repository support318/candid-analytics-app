## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

Since you're using Vercel with auto-deployment:

1. **Commit changes to git:**
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/code/candid-analytics-app
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add user management system"
   git push
   ```

2. **Vercel will automatically:**
   - Detect the changes
   - Build the frontend
   - Deploy to https://analytics.candidstudios.net
   - Usually takes 2-3 minutes

3. **Wait for deployment** and then test!

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

If you prefer to build locally first:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/code/candid-analytics-app/frontend

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Vercel will pick up the build on next push
```

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Change Your Password

1. Go to https://analytics.candidstudios.net
2. Login with: admin / password
3. Click your avatar (top right)
4. Click "My Profile"
5. Fill in the password change form:
   - Current password: `password`
   - New password: `YourSecurePassword123!`
   - Confirm new password: `YourSecurePassword123!`
6. Click "Change Password"
7. You should see success message
8. Logout and login with new password

### 2. Add a New User (Admin Only)

1. Click your avatar (top right)
2. Click "Manage Users"
3. Click "Add User" button
4. Fill in the form:
   - Username: `testuser`
   - Email: `test@candidstudios.net`
   - Password: `Test123456`
   - Full Name: `Test User`
   - Role: `Viewer`
5. Click "Create"
6. User should appear in the table

### 3. Edit a User

1. In the Users table, click the edit icon (pencil)
2. Change any field (like role or email)
3. Click "Update"
4. Changes should be reflected

### 4. Test Permissions

1. Logout from admin account
2. Login as the new user you created
3. Click avatar - you should see "My Profile" but NOT "Manage Users"
4. Try to access `/dashboard/users` directly - should be blocked (only frontend, backend still needs role check)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module '../services/api'"
- Run: `npm install` in frontend directory
- The api.ts service has been created

### "403 Forbidden" when accessing /dashboard/users
- Make sure you're logged in as admin
- Check your user role in profile page
- Non-admin users cannot access this page

### Password change fails with "Invalid password"
- Double-check you're entering current password correctly
- Remember: default is `password` (if not changed yet)

### Build errors on Vercel
- Check Vercel deployment logs
- Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
- Frontend build may take 3-5 minutes

### API returns 500 error
- Check API logs: `docker logs candid-analytics-api --tail 50`
- Verify API container is running: `docker ps`
- Restart if needed: `docker-compose restart api`

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional)

### 1. Fine-tune Permissions
Currently managers and viewers can see all dashboards. You could:
- Hide specific dashboards by role
- Add data-level permissions (e.g., viewers only see own projects)
- Implement department/team filtering

### 2. Add More User Fields
Consider adding:
- Profile photo upload
- Phone number
- Department
- Timezone preference
- Email notifications settings

### 3. Audit Logging
Track user actions:
- Login/logout timestamps
- What data was modified
- Who created/edited users

### 4. Password Reset
Add "Forgot Password" functionality:
- Email-based password reset
- Temporary reset tokens
- Link expiration

### 5. Two-Factor Authentication
Enhanced security:
- TOTP (Google Authenticator)
- SMS verification
- Backup codes
